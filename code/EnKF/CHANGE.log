2012-10: Jon Poterjoy, fixed negative Q bug in enkf.f
                       changes made to obs_io.f

2012-12: Yue Ying, large modification of the algorithm. Affected code: enkf.f main.f sub_enkf_util.f
                   Description of algorithm added to header of enkf.f
2013-1 : Yue Ying, added parallelization to the update zone km(:,:,:), added namelist "parallel".
                   Affected code: enkf.f main.f sub_enkf_util.f module_structure.f xb.f namelist.enkf
     Status quo: 1. calculate y=Hx before update
                 2. domain decomposed to limite cpu memory usage
                 3. update zone decomposed to parallelized the computation of kalman gain
                 4. recv/send (point to point) inter-cpu communication used to minimize data traffic
                 5. state vector data structure kept (i,j,k), and block wise operation are used instead
                    of using loops, to save time.
                 6. random permutation of observation sequence can be used.
2013-5: Yue Ying, subroutine ensemble_mean deprecated.
2014-3: Bug fixs: 1. obs_io.f: assign wind direction error to wind speed fixed, in a lot of places data(n,k,2,2)
                  2. obs_io.f: raw%gts sorting, select data closest to model levels fixed
                  3. obs_io.f: missing grid_id values for a lot of subroutines fixed (useful for ngxn calculation in cal_roi.f, for Radar obs)
2014-4: minor bug fix: ens perturbation not calculated if obs%num==0, causing trouble.
2014-7: Yunji Zhang: 1. In calculation of T2 (part of yf) from state vector x can use model prognostics either T/Qv or Theta/Td.Affected: xb.f
                     2. Add TBLS SMOIS as state vector, fix the calculation of kk (num of vertical levels) of these variables. Affected: sub_enkf_util.f, enkf.f, wrf_var_dimension soubroutine.
        Michael Ying: added filter diagnostics outputs, including prior/posterior RMSEs, consistency ratio.
                     3. Added data type GPSPW, affected xb obs_io namelist
                     4. getting rid of sta= and numlevs= in obs_io, replace with allocatable arrays.
2014-9:           minor bug fix: kick_off index is messed up is using random_order, fixed;
