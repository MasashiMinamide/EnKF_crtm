in the fort.10000 file. The entries (columns from left to right) are:

obs type
lat, lon, height, i, j, k, 
horizontal ROI, vertical, ROI, 
observation (y^o), obs error, 
obs prior mean (H \bar{x}^f)
obs posterior mean (H \bar{x}^a)
observation prior spread (sqrt{H P^f H^T})
observation posterior spread (sqrt{H P^f H^T}), before relaxation (the effect of relaxation will not be reflected here)


So now you can gather all fort.10000 files for each assimilation cycle and perform some screening (taking the subset of these observations w.r.t. time/height/region) and then calculate prior/posterior RMSEs and consistency ratios with the output.
